# 🚀 Linux Ubuntu: Comprehensive Configuration Script

An automated, powerful Bash script designed to transform a clean **Linux Ubuntu** installation with the **gnome** desktop into a complete, optimized workstation ready for both work and entertainment.

> ⚠️ **Note:** At the end of its execution, the script automatically restarts the system to apply all changes (including kernel modules and Plymouth configuration).

---

## ✨ Main Features

The script performs a full system deployment divided into several logical stages:

### ⚙️ 1. Repositories & Updates
* Enables the `i386` architecture (required for games and Wine).
* Extends repositories with `contrib` and `non-free` components on the underlying Ubuntu/Debian base (using the standard `sources.list` format; Ubuntu's own repositories are left untouched).
* Adds official repositories for external applications: **Google Chrome** and **Brave Browser**.
* Activates the **Flathub** repository (Flatpak) — useful since Ubuntu ships with the Software Manager but not Flathub enabled by default.
* Safely waits for APT locks held by other system processes (including the Ubuntu Update Manager / `Ubuntuupdate`) to be released.

### 🎮 2. Gaming, Drivers & Wine
* **Smart GPU Detection:** Automatically identifies your graphics card (NVIDIA / AMD / Intel) and installs dedicated 32-bit libraries, adding the appropriate modules to `initramfs` (forcing early KMS loading for smooth booting).
* For NVIDIA cards, offers to use Ubuntu's built-in `driver-manager` / `Ubuntudrivers` in addition to manual driver installation.
* Installs the latest stable version of **Wine** along with 32-bit audio libraries (PulseAudio, OpenAL).
* Automatically downloads and configures the latest version of **Winetricks**.
* Installs useful gaming tools: `gamemode`, `mangohud`, `vulkan-tools`, `vkd3d-compiler`, `goverlay`.

### 📦 3. Package Management
* **Debloat:** Removes unnecessary or rarely used pre-installed Ubuntu applications (e.g. Hypnotix, Drawing, Celluloid, Pix, Ubuntu Welcome Screen — kept optional/skippable per app).
* **Everyday tools installation:** Over 40 hand-picked packages (including VLC/GStreamer, Telegram, QBitTorrent, Kdenlive, Audacity, Krita, Vim, Fastfetch, BleachBit, rsync, 7zip, and many more).
* **Hardware detection:** Automatically installs missing firmware using `isenkram`.
* Automatically downloads the latest `.deb` packages from designated GitHub releases (e.g. Discord, faugus-launcher, ls-fg).

### 🔒 4. Virtualization & Firewall
* Installs and configures the **QEMU/KVM** virtualization environment and **Virt-Manager**.
* Automatically adds the current user to the `libvirt`, `libvirt-qemu`, and `kvm` groups.
* Configures and enables **UFW** (via Ubuntu's `gufw` front-end where available) — blocks incoming traffic by default, allows outgoing, and opens the necessary ports for the virtualization network bridge (`virbr0`).

### 🎨 5. gnome Desktop Personalization
* **Safe sync:** Copies your pre-made configuration files (`.config`, `.local`, `.icons`) after safely restarting the `gnome` process — preventing gnome from overwriting your settings with defaults during shutdown.
* **User migration:** Automatically scans config files and replaces the old user placeholder (`bartek`) with your current account name.
* Applies custom **gnome themes, applets, and desklets** (if provided) via `dconf`/`gsettings`, instead of KDE's `kwriteconfig`/`plasma-apply-*` tools.
* Configures the **Plymouth** boot splash (using the `bgrt` theme) and hides unnecessary GRUB messages (`quiet splash`).
* Automatically sets the user avatar (via `AccountsService`/`lightdm`), custom gnome splash screen, and wallpapers in multiple resolutions for the *Next*-style theme.

### 🐚 6. Modern Shell (ZSH)
* Sets **ZSH** as the default user shell.
* Installs the **Oh My ZSH** framework in unattended mode.
* Downloads and activates the powerful **Powerlevel10k** theme.
* Adds automatic `fastfetch` invocation on terminal startup and enforces correct UTF-8 encoding.

### ⚡ 7. System Optimizations
* Enables regular SSD trimming via `fstrim.timer`.
* Clears old systemd system logs (`journalctl --vacuum-time=2d`).
* Sets the GRUB menu timeout to `0` seconds (instant boot).
* Configures fast and secure DNS servers (Cloudflare `1.1.1.1`) directly in the active **NetworkManager** configuration (same networking stack as on KDE — Ubuntu uses `nm-applet`/`gnome-settings` on top of it).

## 📂 Required Directory Structure

To allow the script to fully utilize its potential and not skip the visual configuration steps, make sure the following files and folders are present in the script's directory before running it (the script safely skips any missing items):

```text
📂 Your-Repository/
├── 📄 install.sh           # Main installation script
├── 📄 .update.sh          # (Optional) Your personal update script
├── 📄 piwo.png            # (Optional) User avatar image  
├── 📄 5120x2880.png       #  Wallpaper
├── 📂 bleachbit/          # (Optional) Pre-configured BleachBit settings for root
├── 📂 .config/            # (Optional) Your application configuration files (gnome panel/applets included)
├── 📂 .local/             # (Optional) Local app data / scripts
```

## 🚀 How to Run

The script **cannot** be run directly from the `root` account (via `su` or `sudo ./install.sh`). Run it as a regular user with `sudo` privileges. The script will ask for your password once, then temporarily remove the password requirement for installation processes to run uninterrupted.

### Step 1: Clone the repository or download the files
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bartko4321/ubuntu-config.git
```

### Step 2: Enter the downloaded folder
```bash
cd Ubuntu-config
```

### Step 3: Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

### Step 4: Run the script
```bash
./install.sh
```

Once the process is complete, the computer will restart automatically. After logging in, you'll be greeted by a fully configured ZSH environment and a customized gnome desktop!
